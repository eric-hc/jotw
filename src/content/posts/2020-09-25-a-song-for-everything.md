**Hot Takes**

On the GIRL album cover- the jacket looks itchy

It definitely is a song

It's someone's jam

We knew about The Bones

**Song Discussion**

A lot of people can relate to that message 

Not sure we agree with the songs/bands referenced

The references could age the song BUT she does touch on the fact that music can serve as a time machine

Jams can serve as a time machine to transport you to a time with which you associate the particular song

Eric's water dispenser is *our* time machine

*It was a meta jam choice*

***Is it a jam? Honestly, I don't know how you goyles do it***

***This is a soft jam- 2/3 jamminess***
