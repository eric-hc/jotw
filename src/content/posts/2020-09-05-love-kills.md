# Hot Takes
- Matt: painfully 80s
- Jules: huge tempo change each time it came on the car playlist, smooth
- Eric: beautifully 80s

# Notes
Full disclosure from Matt, his dad is a huge Queen fan, watches all the docs and live shows, so he knows a lot; the reason Queen was so good is because of Freddie even though they fought a lot and hated each other
- Queen needed Freddie as much as Freddie needed Queen

Note that Queen memebers recorded this song, Freddie's songwriting and production though

Pretty basic lyrics

>Nominated for nominated for Worst Original Song at the 5th Golden Raspberry Awards

>Nevertheless, the single reached number ten on the UK Singles Chart

So, are Golden Raspberry Awards garbage or are the UK Singles Charts garbage?

Greatest rock singer of all

Bummed because of lyrics, it's a lot of repitition without much substance, near the end kinda wishing it was over UNTIL guitar solo

# Is it a Jam?
- Matt: still a jam (**unexpected**)
- Jules: if you can't take Freddie at his worst, you don't deserve him at his best. It's a jam
- Eric: Freddie is a jam

It's a jam

## Unrelated
Favorite Queen song?
- Jules: I Want to Break Free
- Matt: overall..hm..yeah that's hard (he did ask the question though)
  - over the past six months to a ytear, probably Dragon Attack, but also Brighton Rock
- Eric: there's so many but maybe Don't Stop Me Now or Radio Gaga


Note: it was later discovered at the end of this jam session that Jules listened to the ballad version. take her notes with a grain of sus
